# Sales Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

A **Sales Performance Dashboard**  built using Power BI.  
The goal was to make it easy for sales managers and executives to review sales over time, filter by dates, and drill into details.  
I worked with a sample dataset (originally from an EDW) and designed the dashboard to be simple, interactive, and useful for quick decision-making.

## Project Scenario
I created this dashboard based on a real business scenario:  
- Managers wanted to track sales **by brand and agent**  
- See **daily trends** and drill into order-level details  
- Compare **year-over-year performance** (2020 vs. 2021)  
- Have different week start days for different roles:
  - Sales Manager week: **Sunday to Saturday**
  - CSO week: **Wednesday to Tuesday**

## Key Features
- **Custom date ranges** with flexible slicers  
- **KPIs:** Order Count and Total Quote (without tax)  
- **Drill-down and drill-up:** Click a brand, agent, or day to see more details  
- **Raw data view** showing all fields, including:
  - Total Quoted WO Tax  
  - Mileage charges  
  - Rent and fee details  
  - Transportation budget  
- **Year-over-year comparisons** by day, week, and month  
- Clean visuals with easy navigation
